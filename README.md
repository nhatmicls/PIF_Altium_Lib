## Disclaim

- Local supplier only availble at Viet Nam.
- For local supplier not always supply right manufacturer of passive component so I choice a passive component with same vaule with design. If your product need to use right manufacturer please use global supplies.
- Some component will have wrong parameter please open an issuse for me to fix it asap.
